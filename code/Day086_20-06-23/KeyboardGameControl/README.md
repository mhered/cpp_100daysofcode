# Keyboard Game Control with `ncurses`

I found a pseudocode with a proposed solution to implement a keyboard game controller using `ncurses` that would accept key combinations.

Iused it as inspiratio nto write a simple program to control x,y, and angle of a simple character in a screen


It works but requires pressing keys in every frame (i.e. does not check for keydown/keyup)
