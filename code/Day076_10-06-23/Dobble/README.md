# Dobble

[Dobble](https://www.dobblegame.com/en/homepage/) is a speedy observation card game for 2 players or more. During the game, players have to spot the identical symbol between two cards as quickly as possible to collect cards and score points.

The Dabble deck contains 55 circular cards with 8 graphical symbols each. The cards are designed so there is always one and only one symbol in common between any two cards of the deck. To make the game more interesting, the size and orientation of the graphical symbols varies slightly in each card.

THe link above contains an implementation in python. The underlying mathematics are explained on this blog post: http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/blog/mathematics-toys-and-games/dobble/.

The goal is to go one step beyond and actually produce beautiful Dobble cards adapting the code from [RotateScale](https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/blob/main/code/Day075_09-06-23/RotateScale) and making use of the icons from [Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/).
