# Images

Lets make the `README.md` of our repo a bit nicer by adding the daily images to it.

Practice first on the dummy folder `sandbox` before you go for the full repo!


## Next steps

This works for many common image formats, such as JPG, PNG or WEBP. However, videos and animated gifs don't work. Also, the size of the images is rather large so the resulting `README.md` will be slow to render 

- [ ] as we scan the repo we could create a thumbnail of each image and save it in a separate folder.
- [ ] for videos and animated gifs, we can create a static thumbnail from one of the video frames (maybe not the first because many of my videos start with a fade-in effect)

Both items implemented in the project [Thumbnails]()
