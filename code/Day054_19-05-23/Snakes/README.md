# Snakes
Building on the unfinished example described in the link, code a simple game of Snakes. 
* Use `kbhit` and `getch` from project [Keypress](https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/blob/main/code/Day054_19-05-23/Keypress) to get keyboard input and control the snake. Controls: q - up, a - down, o - left. p - right, x - quit
* when the head of the snake reaches the fruit: increase length of the snake, spawn the fruit elsewhere, update the score (the length of the snake), and increase the speed of the game.
* Implement collision detection with edges and the snake itself
