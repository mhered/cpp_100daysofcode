## Simulate the Game "Rock,  Paper,  Scissors"

Create a function which simulates the game "rock, paper, scissors". The  function takes the input of both players (rock, paper or scissors),  first parameter from first player, second from second player. The  function returns the result as such:

- "Player 1 wins"
- "Player 2 wins"
- "TIE" (if both inputs are the same)

The rules of rock, paper, scissors, if not known:

- Both players have to say either "rock", "paper" or "scissors" at the same time.
- Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper.

### Examples

```
rps("rock", "paper") ➞ "Player 2 wins"
rps("paper", "rock") ➞ "Player 1 wins"
rps("paper", "scissors") ➞ "Player 2 wins"
rps("scissors", "scissors") ➞ "TIE"
rps("scissors", "paper") ➞ "Player 1 wins"
```

### Notes

There are several ways to solve this challenge.
