## FizzBuzz Interview Question

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns `"Fizz"`, `"Buzz"` or `"FizzBuzz"`.

- If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be `"Fizz"`.
- If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be `"Buzz"`.
- If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be `"FizzBuzz"`.
- If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below.
- The output should always be a string even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5.

### Examples

```
fizzBuzz(3) ➞ "Fizz"
fizzBuzz(5) ➞ "Buzz"
fizzBuzz(15) ➞ "FizzBuzz"
fizzBuzz(4) ➞ "4"
```
