# Arkanoid 1 (Tutorials i-ii-iii)

The documentation of the [`olcPixelGameEngine`](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/) game engine by OneLoneCoder(@javidx9) includes a step-by-step tutorial to build a simple Arkanoid clone as an excuse to walk beginners through the main features of the engine. So lets get to it.

The first three tutorials discuss drawing pixels, managing user input, managing pseudo real-time and basic collission detection.
