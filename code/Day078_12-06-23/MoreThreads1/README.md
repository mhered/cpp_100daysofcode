# More threads

Multithreading APIs allow to:
- create threads and signal them to start running, pause, stop and terminate.
- pass parameters to thread worker functions.
- safely share data between threads through the use of locks, mutex, or semaphore facilities.

This example launches two threads that report independently with different delays. The `std::cin` statement does not seem to work though, te code executes and the program terminates. Why?
