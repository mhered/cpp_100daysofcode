# Minesweeper (aka Cross Platform Graphical User Interfaces in C++ , Part II)

In this exercise we expand on the use of `wxWidgets` to build cross-platform GUIs by implementing a simplified Minesweeper game.

* Use `wxGridSizer` to create a dynamically sized grid of buttons
* handle button press: dynamically associate an event handling function with one of the buttons being clicked
