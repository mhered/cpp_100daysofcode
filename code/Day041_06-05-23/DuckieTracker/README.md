# Duckie Tracker
Inspired on the linked tutorials on color detection, object tracking, and shape detection & tracking using contours build an app that will detect duckies on live video, and highlight in green their simplified contours, in white their bounding rectangles, and in red a line tracking the location of their centres over time.

Other recources:
- https://learnopencv.com/deep-learning-with-opencvs-dnn-module-a-definitive-guide/ also has a very good set of tutorials covering filtering, thresholding, blob, edge and contour detection, background estimation as well as deep learning wityh Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch
- Creating Bounding boxes and circles for contours : https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d0c/tutorial_bounding_rects_circles.html

 ## To do
- [ ] refactor!
- [ ] test with more than one duckie
