# Threads 2

For the second example about threads I tried the exercise in [this tutorial](https://coderslegacy.com/cpp-multithreading-tutorial/) to monitor for key strokes while inputting text.

Unfortunately it does not seem to work as intended when I adapted the code for linux using `kbhit()` from project [Keypress](https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/blob/main/code/Day054_19-05-23/Keypress).
