# Counting Cars
This is Part 5 and final of the tutorial series [Car Counting C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ac5rFMNZ0). 

It builds upon the code developed in Part 2 (project [Pedestrians](https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/blob/main/code/Day045_10-05-23/Pedestrians)) to detect movement by image subtraction, the code developed for Part 3 (project [PredictMouseMove](https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/blob/main/code/Day046_11-05-23/PredictMouseMove)) to predict movement based on previous trayectory, and the code developed for Part 4 (project [MultipleObjectTracking](https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/blob/main/code/Day048_13-05-23/MultipleObjectTracking)) to track multiple moving objects.

Note that the tutorial is based on OpenCV v3 and requires tuning some names of functions and constants.

The idea of assigning an individual color to each car and drawing the last portion of the trayectory of the centre was taken from this example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9X3IhHytrQ
