# Lexicon1

Make a simple `Lexicon` class with a `contains()` method that allows to check if the string provided is an English word. 

The motivation for this mini project was completing the `IsAnagram()` example in the [Recursion](https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/tree/main/code/Day023_18-04-23/Recursion) project (based on Lecture 10 by Julie Zelenski for the Programming Abstractions Course - CS106B) 

I made a crude version and will leave it for later to implement something more polished.
