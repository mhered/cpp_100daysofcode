# Toy Car Workshop

You work in a toy car workshop, and your job is to build toy cars from a  collection of parts. Each toy car needs 4 wheels, 1 car body, and 2  figures of people to be placed inside. Given the total number of wheels, car bodies and figures available, how many *complete* toy cars can you make?

```c++
int cars(int wheels, int bodies, int figures)
```



## Examples

```
cars(2, 48, 76) ➞ 0
// 2 wheels, 48 car bodies, 76 figures

cars(43, 15, 87) ➞ 10

cars(88, 37, 17) ➞ 8
```
