# Logging 3

With the help of ChatGP, write a better logging facility that gets the best of the previous attempts and some more:
- defined in a standalone header file
- very easy to use
- implements log levels
- quickly provides log level, timestamp, file and line
- allows to directing log to stdout or to a file
- colors! (only for stdout)
- an `>>>>>>>END OF RUN>>>>>>>>` message printed at tear down to easily separate runs 

I said it before: ChatGPT rocks. It is true that their proposal required some fine tuning, but still.
