# Faster graph plots
The customized graph plots from the GraphPlot project are beautiful but rather slow to display. Lets explore what `matplot::graph()` can do.
Write a `FasterGraphPlot()` function for undirected weighted graphs.
Besides the basic example in the link above, check out as well:

* this example for giving different formats to each marker or edge: https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus/blob/master/examples/graphs/graph/graph_4.cpp
