# Dashboard

Make an automated dashboard integrated in the README file for the 100DaysOfCode showing:
- [ ] overall progress
- [ ] a spider chart with progress per topic (tag)
- [ ] curves of challenges completed
- etc

Also consider improving the log by adding: 
- [ ] table format
- [ ] tags per challenge
- [ ] link to the pictures: download, rename, batch-resize?
- [ ] scrape twitter for final text?:  https://pingthread.com/thread/1640519277366083585
