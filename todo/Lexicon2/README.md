# Lexicon2

Make a Lexicon class with a contains() method that check if a string is a word. 

A crude version was implemented on [Day023](https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/tree/main/code/Day023_18-04-23), using an ordered vector. However this ground to a halt when looking for anagrams of a 9-letter word (and this with very small lexicon of 10,000 words). 

The goal is to make something that works with the ~500k words lexicon linked below!

Explore the Lexicon ADT case study: a discussion on best data structures to store a lexicon, in the link provided, which belongs to the Programming Abstractions Course (CS106B) in the Stanford Computer Science Department.
