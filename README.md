# cpp_100daysofcode

My log for the #100DaysOfCode challenge with C++

* `code` folder contains one folder per day of the challenge. Inside each folder there is one subfolder per challenge taken in the day. 
* `utils` folder contains some helper python functions and template files used to initialize the folder structure and compose the progress tweets 
* `tweet.py` 
  1. reads the title of each challenge from the subfolder names inside the day folder that matches the current date 
  2. inside each challenge subfolder it searches the file `info.md` for the line that starts with `#link:` to extract the link to each challenge
  3. composes a progress tweet to add to the thread.
