# cpp_100daysofcode

My log for the #100DaysOfCode challenge with C++

* `code` folder contains one folder per day of the challenge. Inside each folder there is one subfolder per challenge taken in the day. 
* `utils` folder contains some helper python functions and template files used to initialize the folder structure and compose the progress tweets 
  * `init.py` creates the folder structure and template `main.cpp` and `README.md` files

  * `tweet.py` 
    * reads the title of each challenge from the subfolder names inside the day folder that matches the current date 
    * inside each challenge subfolder it searches the file `README.md` for the line that starts with `#link:` to extract the link to each challenge
    * composes a progress tweet to add to the thread and appends it to this README.md
