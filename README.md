# cpp_100daysofcode

My log for the #100DaysOfCode challenge with C++

* `code` folder contains one folder per day of the challenge. Inside each folder there is one subfolder per challenge taken in the day. 
* `utils` folder contains some helper python functions and template files used to initialize the folder structure and compose the progress tweets 
  * `init.py` creates the folder structure and template `main.cpp` and `README.md` files

  * `tweet.py` 
    * reads the title of each challenge from the subfolder names inside the day folder that matches the current date 
    * inside each challenge subfolder it searches the file `README.md` for the line that starts with `#link:` to extract the link to each challenge
    * composes a progress tweet to add to the thread and appends it to this README.md

Day 15: #100DaysOfCode in #Cpp progress - today I explored the capabilities of ChatGPT. I asked it to solve a programming exercise, comment the code, help me install Google Test framework and write unit tests, then translate the code to python and refactor it to make it more pythonic. The game-changing result in TestDriveChatGPT https://github.com/mhered/cpp_100daysofcode/blob/main/code/Day015_10-04-23/TestDriveChatGPT (based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG3IgW-FBRg).
